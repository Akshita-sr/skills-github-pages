## Project Overview

RoboticsML is a comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithms specifically designed for robotics applications. The project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical machine learning concepts and practical applications in robotics.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python, C++
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, ROS (Robot Operating System)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, Docker
- **Hardware Integration:** Various robot platforms including TurtleBot and custom designs

## Key Features

1. **Perception Algorithms:**
   - Object detection and tracking
   - Semantic segmentation
   - Depth estimation from monocular images

2. **Motion Planning:**
   - Reinforcement learning for path planning
   - Dynamic obstacle avoidance
   - Trajectory optimization

3. **Control Systems:**
   - Adaptive control using neural networks
   - Model predictive control optimization
   - System identification using ML

4. **Human-Robot Interaction:**
   - Gesture recognition
   - Natural language processing for commands
   - Behavior prediction

## Challenges & Solutions

One of the main challenges in this project was creating ML models that could run efficiently on resource-constrained robot hardware. To address this, I implemented:

- Model compression techniques including quantization and pruning
- Edge computing solutions for distributing computation
- Custom lightweight neural network architectures

## Results & Impact

The RoboticsML library has been used in several robotics projects, resulting in:

- 40% improvement in object detection accuracy
- 30% reduction in motion planning computation time
- Successful deployment on 3 different robot platforms

## Future Development

Ongoing and planned future development includes:

- Integration with more robotics middleware
- Expanding the library to include more state-of-the-art algorithms
- Creating comprehensive documentation and tutorials
